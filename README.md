# technical-art

This is a repository for Yuriy Pavlov's technical art projects, including shaders, VFX scripts, and useful visualization tools.

## Notes

Notes are scattered across the subdirectories according to topic. May be reorganized using Obsidian in the future.

## Tutorial files

Shaders and scripts in `tutorial` subdirectories were made from completing [Catlike Coding's Rendering tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/rendering/).

Catlike Coding writes incredibly helpful, beginner-friendly, and mathematically thorough tutorials. I'm deeply grateful to them for having demystified technical art in Unity for me. Support them on their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/catlikecoding)!
