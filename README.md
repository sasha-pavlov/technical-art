# technical-art

This is a repository for Sasha Pavlov's technical art study, including:

- notes on math,
- notes on game development,
- shaders,
- VFX scripts, and
- useful tools.

## Notes

Notes are in `.md` docs. They are organized by topic.

`tutorials` have inline notes as well as short `.md` docs, which are additional takeaways from specific tutorials.

## Tutorial files

Shaders and scripts in `tutorial` subdirectories were made from completing [Catlike Coding's Unity tutorials](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/).

Catlike Coding writes helpful, beginner-friendly, and mathematically thorough tutorials. Support them on their [Patreon](https://www.patreon.com/catlikecoding) or make a [one-time donation](https://catlikecoding.com/unity/tutorials/donating.html).
