# Unity scenes

Everything in a unity game scene is a game object. Assets, including scripts and shaders, become `components` associated with game objects.

## Prefabs

Prefabricated objects can be instantiated (cloned) as game objects.

## Object heirarchy

A game object's local transform (position, rotation, scale) is relative to its parent. The world transform is relative to the world, the root of the object heirarchy.
